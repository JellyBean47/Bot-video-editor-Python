# Bot-video-editor-python

(:This software is experimental and has not been tested as i do not have the neccacry resourses to test it:)

Prototype of a Python-based AI video editing bot that enhances video quality by
improving lighting, contrast, background, and resolution.
A touch of GUI added

The goal is to build an AI-powered video editing bot that:

Inputs: Takes a video file.

Processes:

Enhances lighting and contrast.

Enhances the background to make it look more professional.

Upscales the resolution for better quality.

Outputs: Outputs the edited video.

*Also add a user friendly GUI*

*Prerequisites*
*Ensure you have the following:*

*Operating System: Windows*

*Python: Version 3.8 or above.*

*Hardware: A CUDA-compatible GPU is highly recommended for faster processing,* 
*especially for models like ESRGAN.*

*Internet Connection: To download necessary libraries and pre-trained models.*

1 Setting Up your Environment
------------------------------
Download Python

Visit the official Python website and download Python 3.8 or later.

Install Python

Run the installer.

Important: Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before clicking "Install Now."
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1.1 Install Required Python Libraries
---------------------------------------
Open Command Prompt and run the following commands to install the necessary libraries:

pip install opencv-python moviepy torch torchvision numpy scikit-image tqdm tkinter

Note:
torch and torchvision are essential for running deep learning models.

tkinter is included with Python, but if you encounter issues, you might need to install it separately.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1.2 Install FFmpeg
-------------------
FFmpeg is crucial for video processing.

Download FFmpeg:

Go to the FFmpeg Download Page.

Download the latest static build for Windows.

Install FFmpeg:

Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder, e.g., C:\ffmpeg.

Add FFmpeg to PATH:

Open System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables.

Under System variables, find and select the Path variable, then click Edit.

Click New and add the path to FFmpeg's bin directory, e.g., C:\ffmpeg\bin.

Click OK to save changes.

Verify Installation:

Open Command Prompt and type ffmpeg -version. You should see FFmpeg version details.

1.3 Downloading Pre-trained Models
------------------------------------
ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN)

Download ESRGAN Repository:

Visit the ESRGAN GitHub Repository.

Click on Code > Download ZIP or clone the repository using Git:

git clone https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN.git

Download Pre-trained Weights:

Navigate to the Pre-trained Models section.

Download the RRDB_ESRGAN_x4.pth model.

Place the Model:

Place the downloaded .pth file in the ESRGAN/models directory.

________________________________________________________________________

U2Net (Background Enhancement)

Download U2Net Repository:

Visit the U2Net GitHub Repository.

Click on Code > Download ZIP or clone the repository using Git:

bash

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/xuebinqin/U-2-Net.git

Download Pre-trained Weights:

Download the u2net.pth model from the Pre-trained Models section.

Place the Model:

Place the downloaded .pth file in the U-2-Net/saved_models/u2net directory.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Running the Prototype
----------------------
Ensure Models Are Properly Placed:

ESRGAN/models/RRDB_ESRGAN_x4.pth

U-2-Net/saved_models/u2net/u2net_scripted.pth

Run the Script:

Save the integrated script (from section 5.d) and the GUI script (from section 6) into a single Python file, e.g., video_editor_bot.py.

Open Command Prompt, navigate to the directory containing video_editor_bot.py, and run:
python video_editor_bot.py
Using the GUI:

Select Input Video: Click "Browse" next to "Input Video" and select your video file (e.g., input_video.mp4).

Select Output Video: Click "Browse" next to "Output Video" and specify the path and name for the edited video (e.g., enhanced_video.mp4).

Start Processing: Click the "Start Processing" button. A progress bar will appear in the Command Prompt, and upon completion, you'll receive a success message.

8. Additional Considerations

a. Performance Optimization

GPU Acceleration: Ensure that your system has a CUDA-compatible GPU and that PyTorch is installed with CUDA support. This significantly speeds up processing.

Batch Processing: For large videos, consider processing frames in batches to optimize memory usage.

Parallel Processing: Utilize multiprocessing to handle multiple frames simultaneously.

Error Handling
Implement more robust error handling to manage scenarios like missing models, unsupported video formats, or corrupted files.

Extending Functionality
Additional Enhancements:

Noise Reduction: Use models like Denoising Autoencoders.

Color Grading: Apply color filters to achieve desired aesthetics.

Export Formats: Allow users to select different output formats and codecs.

Real-time Processing: For live video streams, integrate real-time processing capabilities.

User Experience

Progress Bar in GUI: Instead of showing progress in the Command Prompt, integrate a progress bar within the GUI using ttk.Progressbar.

Settings and Preferences: Allow users to adjust enhancement parameters like gamma value, blur intensity, etc.
